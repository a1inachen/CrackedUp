# CrackedUp

This is a 2-mode running game where using opencv, the player will move their phone camera (or something similarly bright) to control the location of a ball. 
In one game mode, the player starts with a limited number of lives and loses lives when they hit (crack) an obstacle. 
The game ends when the player hits an obstacle with no lives left. Alternatively, in the other gamemode, the player tries to hit every obstacle in their path. 
The game ends when the player misses a single obstacle.
